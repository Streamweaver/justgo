Overview
--------

This set of code is the practice code I'm writing while going through the book
THE WAY TO GO by by Ivo Balbaert.  I picked it up on the cheap as an ebook off
of Amazon.

I thought it might be interesting to keep a versioned repository of the code
as I move through the very early stages of learning this language.  It could
be fun to watch the growth of my own understanding of the language as I move 
from zero to something in terms of my understanding of the language conventions
and construction of applications using Go.

Why Go?
-------

There are a number of brief reasons I'm wanting to learn Go and I thought 
I'd list them her bullet time style.

* I think it's likely to grow in the field and I want some kind of first hand
  knowlege about the language.

* The philosophy of the language itself it interesting enough to want to know
  and I think it'll be a great exercise in language theory for me.

* I think the design of the language is likely to be useful in an increasing
  concurrent and cloud based world.

* I want a fast, multi-threaded language option on my toolbox that isn't
  Java (bloated and tired) and isn't C (Complex and tired).

* Why the hell not.
